In this analysis project we will try to answer the following questions:

1. Who were the passengers? (ages,class,gender...)
2. What deck the passengers were and how that relates to their class
3. Where did the passengers come from?
4. Who was alone and who wasn't?
5. What factors helped someone survive the sinking?
